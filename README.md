## Hi Everyone! 🔥

I am Amin Ullah, an enthusiastic software architect with over a decade of experience in the field of software development.

Currently, I serve as the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at ClassNotes. My passion lies in leveraging technology to address tangible challenges and to enhance accessibility in education for people from all walks of life.

During my leisure hours, I actively contribute to open-source projects and indulge in mountain biking.
